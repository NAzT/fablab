There are two programs in this project. 
The first one is for an arduino Uno which will be the transmettor of a predefined text-message.
The second one is the program for the receptor arduinowhich receives the message and draws it on a led-matrixc screen.

XBee shields are used for the wireless communication.

XBee and ht1632c libraries are necessary for these programs.
